About Me
I've been in the IT field over the last 15 years, working within both IT Support and Systems Administration, and have been working to segue into cybersecurity for quite some time.
As of the time of writing this, I'm a student at Kennesaw State University in Kennesaw, GA, which is about 30 mins outside of Atlanta. I'm majoring in Cybersecurity for a Bachelor's degree, and aiming to take on Master's degree soon after.

My goal is to be able to not only be a strong and worthy candidate for a cybersecurity related position, but to also be a sponge and growth within the field of IT overall and teach others as well. In the vastly growth field of cybersecurity, there's enough love, knowledge and guidance to share with everyone.
